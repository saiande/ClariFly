RESERVATIONS:
In this section, you have to enter a customer’s account number, the airport name he is flying from, the airport name he is flying to, his departing date, the number of tickets to be purchased, the airline name, flight number, and leg number. Then you will be redirected to a page indicating if the reservation was successfully made.

MAILING LIST:
When you click on this link, you will be redirected to a page where you will be given the name of all the customers using clariFLY, their physical address, and their email address.


FLIGHT SUGGESTION:
When you click on this link you will be redirected to a page with a flight suggestion list sorted by the airports you visited before.


EMPLOYEE INFO:

The customer representative will not be able to edit any of the employees’ information. All the employees’ information will be displayed except his hourly rate. Customer Representatives should not be able to perform manager-level transactions such as editing employees’ information or deleting and adding users.
